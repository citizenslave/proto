This is a Node.js module.  In an environment with Node.js accessible to the local path, it can be executed from the command-line with:
	node -e "require('./proto').runTests('./txnlog.dat', '2456938384156277127')"

This will parse the txnlog.dat file to provide the following answers:

What is the total amount in dollars of debits?
	$18203.70

What is the total amount in dollars of credits?
	$9366.02

How many autopays were started?
	10

How many autopays were ended?
	8

What is balance of user ID 2456938384156277127?
	$0.00

The test method also asserts the values for the first transaction match those provided in the assignment.

The module can be imported to another Node.js application and used by calling the exported 'process' method.
The filename and a callback function accepting an array of transaction objects and a total record count are the parameters to this method.

Transaction objects contain the following fields:
	type: One of the enumerated transaction types,
	timestamp: Transaction's timestamp,
	userId: String representation of the 64-bit User ID,
	amount: The amount of the transaction for debit and credit type transactions.
